<h2><em>Stasis</em></h2>
<section class="body">
<p style="text-align: center;">
<em>The knights' cold shadows looming,</em><br>
<em>A desperate fight, evermore in stasis.</em><br>
<em>I pick a moonlit flower blooming,</em><br>
<em>Unthinking of the long past crisis.</em><br><br>
</p>
<p>This short poem was inspired by a painting I once saw. The poem depicts what I saw in the painting,
    which was of a dark scene where a young girl picked flowers, seemingly unaware of the stone battle surrounding her.

<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<section class="body">
<p>
    I love music. I've played piano for most of my life, and have recently been learning to play the organ.
    Some of my favorite piano pieces I have learned / am learning include <em>Liebestraume no. 3</em> by Franz Liszt,
    <em>Sweet Remembrance of You</em> by William Joseph, and <em>An American in Paris</em> by George Gershwin.
</p>
<p>
    I love books. I love reading -- especially science fiction and fantasy -- and I enjoy researching new things.
    I also love writing. I love creating worlds and exploring themes applicable to our world through writing.
</p>
<p>
    Recently, I have begun teaching myself digital painting. I've always loved art (and, honestly, anything creative, including cooking),
    and learned how to sketch with pencil and pen while I was fairly young. I love the depth and vibrancy of paintings, I so I've begun learning
    how to paint on my tablet.
